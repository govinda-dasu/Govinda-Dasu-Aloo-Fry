# Govinda-Dasu-Aloo-Fry

1. For the Govinda Dasu Aloo Fry, you should always plan on at least two medium potatoes per person, or you will not have any aloo fry left for yourselves when it comes to the concluding yogurt-rice course.
2. The number of potatoes should be between four and ten for a 12-inch skillet, otherwise you will end up with either burnt or lumped up fry.
3. California white rose potatoes work the best, but those rose-peeled versions are acceptable. If you are using Idaho potatoes, do get rid of those pesky black spots. I would avoid the yellow-gold potatoes from Yukon.
4. It is of utmost importance to cut the potatoes properly. If you manage to get the potatoes peeled and cut in cubes with sides measuring 0.6 Â± 0.2 cm you are doing well.
5. I would definitely recommend practicing the peeling of the entire potato without ever breaking the peel. Such obsession will ensure that potato cubes are properly cut. My mother certainly disagrees with this recommendation, although my father approves, having passed this important tidbit to me.

1. Put two to four table spoons of peanut/sunflower/safflower/sesame oil (do avoid using lighter canola oil) in the pan and heat at medium-high level.
2. Before the oil fumes, add the potatoes and mix them carefully so that the oil coats all the potato pieces. Do not ever put pressure on the potatoes. Rather, you should tilt the pan slightly and mix the potatoes with the plastic spatula using gravity assistance for tossing!
3. Do not overdo the mixing, but do not leave the kitchen to watch the TV show either.
4. Periodic mixing till the potatoes are golden-brown does need some level of obsession.
5. You can go to the fridge and get green curry leaves, wash, dry and keep ready for future use, to keep you occupied.
6. You can also ensure that the water from the rice dish on the backburner is not spilling over.
7. Do keep powdered salt, inguva (asafetida), turmeric and red-chilies handy.
8. As the potatoes turn light brown, add powdered salt (0.5 teaspoons per person), inguva (a pinch) and turmeric (a pinch).
9. Turn the potatoes with light touch and gravity assistance. If you have already got some potato stuck to the pan, do not fret.
10. Try to scrape the potato mash out with plastic spatula without putting undue pressure on the remaining potato cubes. The scrapes will fry to darker brown adding texture and taste.
11. After that minute of struggle and cussing, lower the heat and add green curry leaves and red-chili powder (0.25 teaspoons per person).
12. Your mouth should be already watering watching the golden-brown potatoes with hues of red. You will thank yourselves for having the foresight of preparing the plain rice ahead of the Govinda Dasu Aloo Fry.
